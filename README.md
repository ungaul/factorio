# Factorio Space Age Map Viewer

This website displays a Factorio map generated using [MapShot](https://github.com/Palats/mapshot). It provides an interactive interface to explore my Factorio base called **Factorio: Space Age**.

## Description

The viewer uses tile images produced by MapShot to render the Factorio map. The application is built with Leaflet and jQuery and features a custom overlay menu that groups map layers into categories and layers.

Users can navigate, zoom, and toggle layers on the map. The URL is dynamically updated with the mapâ€™s center and zoom level for easy sharing of the current view.

## Prerequisites

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [MapShot](https://github.com/Palats/mapshot) (used to generate the map tiles)

## Usage

- **Map Navigation:** Use your mouse or the zoom controls to pan and zoom around the map.
- **Overlay Menu:** Click on the buttons in the overlay menu to toggle the different layers.
- **URL Sharing:** The URL updates automatically with the current map position and zoom level.
